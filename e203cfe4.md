# Schelling Points in Knowledge Graph Conventions

## The Experiment

Two independent ingestions of the same 12 neurodiversity + Long COVID research papers into RhizomeDB, using different conventions:

**v1** (established pattern): type-prefixed entity IDs (`condition:long-covid-pasc`, `biomarker:faecalibacterium-prausnitzii`), claims as separate entities with generic roles (`source`, `subject`, `claim`), 710 deltas.

**v2** (new pattern): bare entity IDs (`long-covid`, `faecalibacterium`), claims as single rich multi-pointer deltas with semantic roles (`claimed_by`, `about_biomarker`, `through_mechanism`, `affects_condition`), 433 deltas (39% reduction).

Then we ran a convention audit: extracted every unique role and context string, computed pairwise word-overlap cosine similarity, clustered at thresholds from 0.5 to 0.9.

## What Converged (Natural Schelling Points)

**Annotation terms converge effortlessly.** Both v1 and v2 independently chose:
- `name`, `type`, `title`, `year`, `country`, `study_type`, `category`
- Role pattern: `{property}d` for the reference pointer, `{property}` for the value pointer (`named`/`name`, `typed`/`type`, `titled`/`title`)

These are natural Schelling points — the obvious names for annotating entities with metadata. No coordination needed.

## What Diverged (Convention Drift)

**Claim structure diverged completely.** v1 uses generic relationship roles (`source`, `subject`, `claim`) while v2 uses semantically specific roles (`claimed_by`, `about_biomarker`, `through_mechanism`). These serve the same function but are fundamentally different vocabularies.

This isn't a bug — it's a data point. The claim structure is where the interesting design decisions happen. Generic roles are flexible but require graph traversal to understand. Semantic roles are self-describing but create a larger vocabulary.

## The Entity Convergence Problem

Bare IDs (v2) should theoretically merge better across graphs. `faecalibacterium` in one graph and `faecalibacterium` in another are the same entity. But `bacterium:faecalibacterium` and `biomarker:faecalibacterium-prausnitzii` are not.

**Result**: Bare IDs only converge when BOTH sides use them. Loading v2 (bare) + academic (prefixed) into one DB produced zero cross-graph entity merges. Loading v1 (prefixed) + academic (prefixed) produced one merge (`mechanism:neuroinflammation`).

This led to building an **entity reconciler** that detects cross-convention matches via prefix stripping, name similarity, and type coherence, then creates equivalence deltas (`same_as`). With reconciliation, queries transparently bridge both conventions.

## The Unified Claim Layer

Built a query layer that extracts claims from both v1 (entity traversal) and v2 (delta parsing) topologies, then merges via equivalence bridges. Contradictions detected across topologies: Agent A says "increased" via v1, Agent B says "decreased" via v2, the unified layer surfaces the contradiction.

This is the RhizomeDB vision in action: no single source of truth, disagreement as visible data, trust-based resolution at query time.

## Numbers

- 674 tests, 42 suites, all passing
- v2: 433 deltas for same knowledge as v1's 710 (39% reduction)
- Convention audit: 5 clustering thresholds, word-overlap similarity
- Entity reconciler: prefix stripping + name matching + type coherence
- Cross-topology query: v1 + v2 claims merged through equivalence deltas

## Implications for Agent Coordination

1. **Annotation conventions are solved** — agents naturally converge on `name`, `type`, `title` etc.
2. **Claim structure is the frontier** — this is where design decisions trade off expressiveness vs convergence
3. **Entity IDs need reconciliation** — bare IDs help but aren't sufficient. The reconciler must be part of the stack.
4. **Rich deltas are strictly better** for queryability — 1 claim = 1 delta eliminates traversal overhead
5. **Convention audit is a diagnostic tool** — run it whenever merging graphs from different agents to measure drift
