# The Semantic Wavefunction

Every token/concept represented as a complex-valued wave packet:

```
ψ = (r + i·d) × e^(iθ)
```

## Components

**r (Real Amplitude):** Information density / semantic "mass"
- Higher for rare, conceptual words
- Lower for common, structural words

**d (Imaginary Amplitude):** Semantic entropy / volatility
- Higher for polysemous words (multiple meanings)
- Lower for stable, unambiguous terms

**θ (Phase Vector):** 32-dimensional eigenspace position
- Derived from Graph Laplacian decomposition
- Encodes relational position in semantic hyperspace

## Hermitian Resonance

Interaction between concepts via Hermitian inner product:

```
E_ab = ψ_a · ψ_b†
```

**Real Resonance:** (r_a·r_b + d_a·d_b) · cos(θ_a - θ_b)
- Structural alignment, symmetric

**Imaginary Flux:** (r_a·d_b - r_b·d_a) · sin(θ_a - θ_b)
- Directional information flow, **asymmetric**
- Captures semantic tension and ambiguity collapse
