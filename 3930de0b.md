# The Groovy Commutator in Quantum Mechanics

## The Canonical Example

The fundamental quantum groovy structure:

```
[x̂, p̂] = iℏ
```

This IS the prototypical non-zero groovy commutator.

## Why It Matters

Position and momentum cannot be simultaneously diagonalized because differentiation (momentum) does not commute with the position operator.

**Quantum mechanics is fundamentally groovy.**

## Setup

- **D**: [Ĥ, ·] - commutator with Hamiltonian
- **I**: operator addition
- **C**: commutator [A, B] = AB - BA

## Interpretation

Non-zero G detects **quantum non-integrability**—the failure of Heisenberg evolution to commute with itself across derivative levels.

The uncertainty principle is a manifestation of groovy non-commutativity.
