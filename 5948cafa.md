# The Phantom Limb Test

**Hypothesis:** If we delete a high-resonance function, will its semantic "ghost" remain visible?

## Experiment

Deleted function `xa` (React Fiber Reconciler) with **127 edges** from the TodoMVC graph, then recomputed spectral signature.

## Results

- Eigenvalue correlation: **1.000000** (perfect preservation)
- Ghost resonances persisted among xa's former partners
- Functions that coupled through xa now showed direct coupling

## Interpretation

Information is distributed **non-locally** in phase space.

Deleting syntax doesn't delete semantics. The "shape of the absence" persists.

## Connection to Terrence Deacon

This validates Deacon's concept of the **absential**—constraint-based causation where what's NOT there shapes what IS.

When we delete function xa:
- The syntax is gone (particle removed)
- The semantic "shape" persists (wave continues)
- The absence is causally active (other nodes resonate where xa "should" be)
