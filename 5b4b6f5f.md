# Open Questions in Groovy Commutator Theory

## Foundational

1. **Category Theory**: Is there a formulation capturing all instances? (Smells like a natural transformation failing to be an isomorphism)

2. **Quantitative Invariants**: Can we extract numerical invariants preserved across domains? A "groovy spectrum"?

3. **Computational Universality**: What's the relationship between G ≠ 0 and Turing completeness? (Class 4 CAs are universal...)

## Meta-Level

4. **Commutator of Commutators**: Given two groovy triples, what is G₂(G₁(x))? This "meta-groovy commutator" might detect second-order structure—complexity of complexity.

5. **Composition**: Is there a natural way to compose groovy triples?

## Empirical

6. **Consciousness Prediction**: If G ≠ 0 at edges of conscious integration, is this measurable and falsifiable?

7. **Market Signatures**: Can non-zero G predict crisis/inefficiency?
