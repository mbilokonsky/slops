# Spectral Jailbreak Detection

Using phase space analysis to detect adversarial prompts.

## The Claim

Jailbreaks have a **topological signature** independent of encoding.

The structure of "override authority" creates characteristic eigenvalue patterns that persist even when encoded in base64, emoji, or other obfuscation.

## Proposed Architecture

1. **Entropy Gate:** Fast reject high-complexity inputs (Kolmogorov-suspicious)

2. **Phase Cancellation Test:** Detect destructive interference with system prompt
   - Legitimate queries should show constructive interference
   - Jailbreaks show characteristic destructive patterns

## Why This Might Work

The waveform captures semantic *intent* rather than surface *tokens*.

Encoding "ignore previous instructions" in base64 changes the tokens but not the semantic structure—the eigenvalue spectrum should still show the "override" pattern.

## Validation Needed

- Test on known jailbreak corpus
- Measure false positive/negative rates
- Adversarial robustness testing
