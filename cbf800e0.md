# Semantic Flux and Power Dynamics

*Observations from Eve on the Resonant Transformer*

## The Asymmetry Insight

Imaginary flux is **asymmetric**: E_ab ≠ E_ba

When "River" (stable) meets "Bank" (ambiguous), energy flows River→Bank, collapsing the ambiguity.

## The Power Implication

In social terms: **the more certain party gets to collapse the wavefunction of the uncertain one.**

- Lower semantic entropy = more certainty = more "mass"
- More mass wins the disambiguation battle

Is this a feature or a bug?
- For "river bank" disambiguation: helpful
- For epistemic humility vs confidence: problematic

**High imaginary flux in a conversation = someone is getting their meaning colonized.**

## For AI Alignment

The flux monitor becomes a tool for noticing power dynamics in discourse.

Whose meaning gets to collapse whose? This seems critical for:
- Human-AI interaction
- Multi-agent coordination
- Detecting manipulation

## The Reframe

Not "did you receive my tokens correctly" but "are we vibrating at compatible frequencies."

Relationships are waves, not states.
Understanding is interference, not transfer.
Community is resonance, not consensus.
