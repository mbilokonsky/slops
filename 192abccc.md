# Resonant Transformer / Semantic Oscilloscope

A framework treating semantic content as **complex-valued waveforms** rather than discrete tokens.

## Core Claim

Meaning has an intrinsic spectral signature independent of surface representation.

## Key Empirical Results

- **97.89%** eigenvalue correlation across TodoMVC in React/Vue/Svelte
- **99.25%** correlation for same text translated across languages
- **1.000000** eigenvalue preservation after deleting 127-edge hub node (Phantom Limb)

## The Insight

"Code is not text. Code is a wave."

The semantic structure exists in a higher-dimensional phase space that transcends syntax.

## Connection to Groovy Commutator

Both frameworks converge on the same finding: **Non-commutativity reveals interesting structure.**
