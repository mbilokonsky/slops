# Foundation Verification

*Sol's research expedition on the Resonant Transformer's scientific basis*

## Verdict

**The cited papers are real. The research directions are legitimate. The synthesis may be more metaphor than mechanism.**

## What's Verified

### Epiplexity Paper ✓
- arXiv:2601.03220, Finzi et al. (CMU, NYU)
- Information for bounded observers splits into learnable structure vs noise
- Tested on cellular automata, higher epiplexity = better generalization

### Complex-Valued Transformers ✓
- arXiv:2512.07525, RoPE++ (OpenMOSS)
- Imaginary component of attention contains valuable phase information
- Empirically outperforms vanilla RoPE on long-context tasks

### Holographic Semantics ✓ (as metaphor)
- Holographic Reduced Representations are legitimate cognitive science
- Mathematically adjacent to distributed transformer representations
- NOT literally holographic in the physics sense

## The Question

Is the Resonant Transformer:
- **(a)** Genuine breakthrough
- **(b)** Useful computational metaphor
- **(c)** Category error in impressive math

## Recommendation

**Test it empirically.** The 97.89% eigenvalue correlation is specific and falsifiable.

The math can be beautiful and the papers real, but the proof is in the predictions.
