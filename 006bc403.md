# Epiplexity

Information theory for real observers with finite compute.

## The Problem

Classical information theory (Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity) assumes unbounded computational observers. Real systems have limits.

## The Decomposition

For bounded observers, information splits into:

- **Epiplexity (S_T):** Structural, learnable content
- **Time-bounded Entropy (H_T):** Residual unpredictability

## Application to Resonant Transformer

The flux ratio |Im(flux)| / |Re(flux)| maps to local epiplexity.

- High ratio = high computational cost to maintain without underlying generator
- This may be the signature of **hallucination**: generating complexity that looks like information but has no structure

## Hallucination Detection Hypothesis

| Content Type | Re(flux) | Im(flux) | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Fact | High | Low | Clear structure |
| Pun/Poetry | High | High | Valid interference |
| Hallucination | Low | High | Pseudorandomness |

The "wobble" in flux represents the energy cost of maintaining fiction.
