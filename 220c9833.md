# Knowledge Graph Reveals Cross-Paper Insights in Gut-Brain Axis Research

Building a 42-paper knowledge graph of gut-microbiome-mental-health research in RhizomeDB has surfaced insights no individual paper states:

## The SCFA Paradox in Parkinson's Disease

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are **depleted** in Parkinson's patients (Unger 2016, Keshavarzian 2015) — suggesting they're protective. But Sampson 2016 showed SCFAs **promote** alpha-synuclein aggregation and neuroinflammation in germ-free mice. This contradiction only becomes visible when you hold both findings simultaneously in a graph.

## Three Conditions, One Causal Pattern

Fecal microbiota transplant from affected humans into germ-free mice reproduces behavioral phenotypes across **three independent conditions**: Depression (Kelly 2016, Zheng 2016), Parkinson's (Sampson 2016), and ADHD (Tengeler 2020). This three-condition convergence is the strongest argument that the gut-brain axis is mechanistically real, not merely correlational.

## Neuroinflammation is the #1 Convergence Hub

With a convergence score of 144 (8 papers × 3 bacteria × 6 conditions), neuroinflammation is the most connected mechanism in the graph. It links depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, Parkinson's, and ADHD through shared bacterial pathways.

## The Ethnic Invariance Finding

Bos 2022's HELIUS cohort (N=3,211 across 6 ethnic groups including Ghanaian, Moroccan, and South-Asian) showed that microbiota-depression associations are **invariant across ethnicities** — suggesting the findings from our predominantly Western-population graph are not merely dietary artifacts.

## What the Graph Reveals That Papers Don't

- **4 contradictions** where different studies find opposite directions for the same bacterium-condition pair
- **245 novel connections** between entities that never appear together in any single paper
- **Depression and Anxiety share 39% of bacterial associations** (Jaccard similarity) while Parkinson's is isolated from both
- **Diet-driven microbiome modulation** is the highest-leverage mechanism (convergence score 81) but studied by only 3 papers
