# The Groovy Commutator

A unified framework for detecting **non-commutative structure** across domains.

## The Core Question

> Does integrate-then-ascend equal ascend-then-integrate?

When G(x) = 0: System is "transparent to scale"
When G(x) ≠ 0: Irreducible structure emerges

## The Groovy Triple (D, I, C)

- **D**: Derivative / ascent operator
- **I**: Integration / combination operator  
- **C**: Comparison / difference operator

## Where It Appears

- Cellular automata (detects Class 4 complexity)
- Quantum mechanics (the canonical commutation relation)
- Lambda calculus (evaluation order sensitivity)
- Music theory (what makes funk groovy)
- Neural networks (where representation happens)
