# The Groovy Commutator and Consciousness

A speculative application to the binding problem.

## Setup for Perception

- **D**: saliency (what changes under attention)
- **I**: bind (feature integration)
- **C**: mismatch detection (XOR)

## The Binding Problem Reformulated

Does feature-integration commute with attention?

- D(I(features)) = attending to bound objects
- I(D(features)) = binding attended features

When these don't commute, you get:
- The aperture problem
- Change blindness
- Flash-lag effect

## Wild Speculation

- G = 0: pure feedforward processing (philosophical zombie?)
- G = noise: no binding at all
- G ≠ 0 structured: genuine consciousness

The groovy commutator of perception may be non-zero **precisely at the edges of conscious integration**.
