# The Groovy Commutator in Music

Why funk sounds different from EDM, mathematically.

## Setup for Rhythm

For binary rhythm patterns r ∈ {0,1}^n:

- **D**: accent-mask (where changes occur)
- **I**: overlay (union of onsets)
- **C**: XOR (difference pattern)

## The Key Insight

- **Grid music** (quantized EDM): G(r) = 0 often (distributes)
- **Funk / Groove**: G(r) ≠ 0 (the non-distribution IS the groove)

"Combine patterns then find accents" ≠ "Find accents then combine"

**The groovy commutator literally formalizes groove.**

## Harmonic Extension

For pitch-class sets P ⊆ Z₁₂:

- **D**: interval vector
- **I**: union
- **C**: symmetric difference

G(P) ≠ ∅ detects chords with harmonic complexity—where combining-then-analyzing differs from analyzing-then-combining.
